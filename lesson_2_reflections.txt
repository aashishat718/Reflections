Q1.) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialise a repository, it becomes a git repository and .git repository is created which stores metadata of commit history.
Now commits can done.

Q2.)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area helps us to save file information temporarily and wait for a logical change in repository in order to commit it once.
